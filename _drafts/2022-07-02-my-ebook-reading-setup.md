I used to have a simple life — I'd buy books off Amazon, and read them on a Kindle.  But over the past few years, my reading habits changed drastically.  I'm now reading a lot more things, from a lot more sources, on a lot more devices.  Amazon and the Kindle were inadequate for my needs, but I still wanted a relatively convenient setup for fetching and reading ebooks.  Here I'm writing up my ebook getting and reading setup, and the reasoning behind each of the decisions I've made. 

## Where I get books

### The library

Libraries are great because you can borrow books for free, which sounds obvious but is quite easy to forget when you're in any ecosystem.  I pay council tax, of which a portion goes towards my local council library.  My library is part of the Libraries Consortium, and through Overdrive they provide ebooks to borrow, for free.  Joining was easy — I only had to walk in with proof of address, I got a library card, and that was my login details for the online library.  

The selection is actually better than I thought it would be, and I regularly find several items from my 'Want to Read' list.  Since there are limited copies of these ebooks (due to publisher restrictions), I don't always find the book available to borrow right away, but I can place a hold on them.  I get notified by email when it's available to borrow, at which point I go and download it, and add it to my Calibre library.
