Summary

Pandemic affected holidays. 
Picking up photography again after few years. 
Editing software landscape has changed. 
More choices now and slightly different workflows. 
LR still widely used. LR6 download gone.  LR CC and 'classic' only.  
Both are a subscription lock-in. Stop paying, and you can't develop photos anymore. Infrequent access is quite expensive. 
No confidence in Lightroom Classic - no product has ever been named classic with a future for it in mind. 
Cross-purposes debate - enthusiasts vs professionals. 

Digikam for digital asset management. 
Excellent management features. Picking, coloring, stars. Geotagging. Metadata. Similarity search. 

Editing - Capture One Pro, DXO PhotoLab, ON1 Photo Raw, Skylum. 
Capture One Pro pretty good, but nickel-and-diming now. High cost, and no updates. 
PhotoLab too advanced and unclear marketing page. 
Photo RAW also good, middle ground. Decent cost and reasonable updates. Respects time/money.  
Skylum too basic.

Editing workflow uses machine learning models to help identify and pick areas of photo including sky, mountain, ground. Add them to a layer for editing. 

Lesson learned - never export directly from Lightroom. The changes stuck in LRCAT and too much effort to extract out. Keep the final output locally.
